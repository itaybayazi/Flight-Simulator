# Flight-Simulator
Flight simulator and anomaly detector project.

This application examine and display your flight, locate any anomalys on your flight compering a built-in regular flight data using linear regression,Welzl and ZScore algorithms.
The application connects and display the flight via FlightGear simulator 2020.3.

The Application have a media control panel where you can upload your flight and control the simulator speed,time step and more.
In addition, the application display flight data on a board using graphs,gauges, sliders and bars. 
also, while using the anomaly detections algorithms the application will display those real time detections for the selected feature.

Programming language:
Java
